## How to Play

### Game Rules:

1. **Objective:**
   Your goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. If your total exceeds 21, you lose.

2. **Card Values:**
   - Number cards are worth their face value.
   - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
   - Aces can be counted as 1 or 11, depending on your total.

3. **Game Flow:**
   - Click 'Start Game' to begin a new round.
   - You will be dealt two cards initially. You can then choose to draw additional cards ('+ Card').
   - Decide when to stop drawing cards and click 'Confirm Decision'. The computer will then draw its cards.
   - After the computer's turn, the winner will be determined based on the total points.

4. **Winning:**
   - If your total is closer to 21 than the computer's total, you win!
   - If the computer's total is closer to 21 or if you exceed 21, you lose.

5. **Play Again:**
   - After each round, you can click 'Play Again' to start a new game.

Enjoy the game and good luck!
